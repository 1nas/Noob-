# Hello world

A newcomer and a noob coder, still learning C++ and will start poring Java in my next semester. 

I've just putting it all out on changing my major to software engineering. But to be frank, I'm a total noob. Nevertheless, I crave for making some process to be a good coder. I've been yearning for partaking in a project, no matter its scale (and I don't think I'm skilled enough, there are still too much to learn) to master the knowledge.

By the way, I'm a Chinese student. 

Thank you.
